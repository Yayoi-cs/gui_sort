## Installation
All of the programs rely only on Pythonâ€™s built-in modules, so no additional pip packages are required.
If you find that tkinter is missing (this can happen on some Linux distributions), you may need to install it via your system package manager. For example, on Ubuntu you can run:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
